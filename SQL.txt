7.Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.
After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter

# Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
# Write your MySQL query statem
#delete from Person where (disticnt(email) ;
#using self join
DELETE p2 FROM Person p1,Person p2
WHERE
    p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id < p2.id

8.Write an SQL query to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
